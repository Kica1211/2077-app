        content:
            "Hey Choombas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe wanted to address some concerns which have recently appeared in regards to possible copyright problems connected with streaming Cyberpunk 2077 and its soundtrack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs always, we encourage everyone to create videos using content from our games and we love to see you stream them. With the launch of Cyberpunk 2077, we are incredibly excited to see your streams, playthroughs, Let’s Play videos, achievement guides, hell, maybe even speedruns of our upcoming RPG!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCyberpunk 2077 will feature a beautiful, robust original score created by our in-house composers. In addition, you will be able to listen to over 150 songs created by wonderful artists representing diverse genres and we are confident you will love the music played by the in-game radio stations and in clubs. Unfortunately, the world of copyright law is complicated and not all of these songs can be streamed or used in your video content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last thing we want is for you to run into any copyright issues. Because of this, we have created a dedicated feature for content creators. The “Disable Copyrighted Music” toggle, available in the game’s settings, will disable a small portion of in-game tracks, streaming of which could otherwise result in demonetization or takedowns of your videos or stream clips/VODs. Be sure to have this option enabled before you start streaming or recording your Cyberpunk 2077 content!",
